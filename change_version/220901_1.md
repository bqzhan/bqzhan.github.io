This is a brief version of the study entitled "The influencing mechanism of multi-factors on green investments: A hybrid analysis", which is also my first published paper. The full version of this study can be referred to: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.117977](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.117977). 

# Background

This study mainly focuses on green investment and examine the influence of different factors, including political, economical and environmental factors. We start this research from a macro background. In recent years, the Chinese government has paid great attention to environmental protection. Not only a numerous of environmental policies are released and implemented, but also large volume of resources and money are invested to cope with environmental problems. We wonder whether the governments' policies are taken effects, and what's the relationship between these policies and other economic and environmental factors, as well as how they play the role in stimulating the green investment development. These are the main research questions that we are going to explore. To answer these questions, we mainly collect two data sets (i.e., environmental policies and interprovincial statistical data) and build the research model as follows. 

# Data

The environmental policies are fetched from the official websites of Chinese provincial department of environmental protection. In this text corpus, we totally obtain 1,339 documents of environmental policies. Besides, the interprovincial statistical data including different types of green investments, economic factors (i.e., GDP, GDP per capita, fixed-assets investment) and environmental factors (e.g., waste water, waste gas, waste solid) are obtained from China Statistics Yearbook (2003-2016) and China Environmental Statistics Yearbook (2003-2016). Specifically, green investments are comprised of urban infrastructure investments (GI_UI), treatment of industrial pollution investments (GI_TP) and environmental protection acceptance projects investments (GI_EP).

# Research model

## Text mining

We mainly use LDA topic model to quantify the environmental policies. Assume that each policy document in a corpus  is composed of a mix of multiple topics, then the document  can be generated in the following process (Blei et al. 2003).

1.   Choose document length `$N$` from Dirichlet distribution `$N\sim Dir(\beta)$` .

2.   Choose `$\theta$` from Dirichlet distribution `$\theta\sim Dir(\alpha)$`.

3.   For each word in the document, choose `$z_n\sim Multinomial(\theta)$`, choose `$w_n$`  from a multinomial distribution `$p(w_n|z_n, \beta)$` conditioned on the topic `$z_n$` .

where `$\alpha$` and `$\beta$` are the hyper-parameter of the Dirichlet prior determined based on the topic distribution and word distribution, respectively. The K-demensional Dirichlet random variable `$\theta$` is the probabilistic distribution of document-topic matrix. `$w_n$` denotes the `$n$`th word and `$z_n$` indicates the latent topic assigned to `$w_n$`.

In order to infer the topic distribution for each document and the content of each
topic, we use EM algorithm to estimate the topic distribution (latent variable `$z$`). As a result, the LDA model outputs a list of words with different probabilities categorized by topics. We name these topics according to top words ordered in decreasing probability in each topic.

## Spatial econometric model

Both economic and environmental factors have a spatial heterogeneity. However, whether political factors have spillover effects remain unknown. Therefore, we use spatial analysis to find out the spatial characteristics and test the spillover effects of multi-factors on green investments. In particular, spatial Durbin model (SDM) is built as follows.

`$$\ln GI=a+\rho S \ln GI + X \Theta_1 + SX \Theta_2 + \varepsilon $$`

where `$\ln GI$` denotes natrual logarithm of green investments, `$\Theta_1$` and `$\Theta_2$` are parameter vectors of a series of independent variables and their spatial interaction terms, respectively. `$\rho$` refers to the spatial autocorrelation
coefficient.  `$a$` is the constant and `$\varepsilon$` is the error term. The interaction terms of spatial weights matrix and variables are used to capture spatial
spillover effect of each variable.

# Results

As shown in the table, three topics are extracted from LDA model, and the probabilistic distribution of corresponding top words are presented.  We cluster the policies that belong to each topic and name the topic according to the contents of these policies.

We use the probabilities of different topics as political variables in the regression model. The following table shows the results of spatial model.

From the table, we find that the environmental regulation factor `$p^1_{t-1}$` has significant and positive effect on `$\ln GI$` and `$\ln GI_{UI}$`. It means that total GI has a tremendous increase under the government’s environmental regulation,
especially for the part of `$\ln GI_{UI}$`. Besides, `$p^1_{t-1}$` also performs a negative impact on `$\ln GI_{EP}$`, causing the reduce of environmental
facilities investments. In contrast, the pollution treatment factor `$p^2_{t-1}$` has negative effect on `$\ln GI_{UI}$` while having positive effect on `$\ln GI_{EP}$` instead. We can infer that there have mutual controlling and balancing effect between `$p^1_{t-1}$` and `$p^2_{t-1}$`. The environmental public governance factor `$p^3_{t-1}$` positively associates to `$\ln GI$`, but having no relationship with the other types of GI. Different political factors may exert different effects on GI.
Obviously, the government plays different roles in leading the development of GI, performing its macro-control function through environmental policies.

As for spatial effects, the regulation factor `$p^1_{t-1}$` is significant in `$\ln GI$`, `$\ln GI_{UI}$`, `$\ln GI_{TP}$` and `$\ln GI_{EP}$`. However, the parameters of `$\ln GI$`, `$\ln GI_{UI}$` and `$\ln GI_{EP}$` are negative while that of `$\ln GI_{TP}$` is positive, which can be inferred that the environmental policy has strong pertinency. The same policy may produce different effects on different types of GI of neighboring provinces. As for `$\ln GI_{TP}$` , we find that most provinces with strong regulation political factor are economically developed provinces, such as Beijing, Jiangsu and so on. Around these provinces are industrial-oriented provinces (e.g., Henan, Shandong, Zhejiang). Therefore, to prevent the pollution diffusion, neighboring provinces are always required to invest more `$\ln GI_{TP}$` for pollution treatments. Regarding pollution treatment factor `$(p^2_{t-1})$`, it has negative spillover effect on `$\ln GI_{TP}$`. Public governance factor `$(p^2_{t-1})$` does not have significant effect on any types of GI. Apparently, these political factors have their exclusive effects on a certain type of GI, which means that it’s possible for government to adjust the political orientations and make policy more pertinent to different environmental issues.

# Conclusion

In this paper, we reveal the relationship between GI and its influencing factors. Besides, our study dedicates in text mining of policy. A series of data processing steps are conducted and policies are quantified as political factors, which included three
orientations: environmental regulation & protection, pollution prevention
& treatment and public governance. Our model has cultivated deeper
characteristics of environmental policies, which makes the political factor more
objective and reliable. Then, we build spatial Durbin models to test the direct effects and spillover effects of three factors. The influence of multi-factors on GI manifests that: (1) the government plays different roles, especially in setting up and monitoring environmental regulation. (2) different political factors control and balance each other mutually. (3) The spillover effects of political factors are more salient than direct effects. (4) Most factors’ spillover effects are completely opposite to direct effects,
particularly for economic and environmental factors.
