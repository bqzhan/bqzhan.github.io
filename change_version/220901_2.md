Well, I have kept on writing blogs since from my post-graduate. It has been nearly for 5 years. In the past days, I was used to write Chinese blogs, which are more about the notes of online courses. Yeah, I always engoy taking online courses in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), which has taught me a lot. I feel so grateful for that. For those what I learned and what I thought, I would try to take some notes to help me better understand them. The previous blogs  are posted in [my old blog site](http://kibo.tech/). 

About two months ago, I found that I rarely record my research. Actually, I have spent most of my time in doing research in the past few years, I believe that these research deserves more attention. That' s the reason why I establish this site. I build this place to post my pervious research as well as the current work. 

Ok, this is all about my blog.  I hope that more research can be posted in the near future.
