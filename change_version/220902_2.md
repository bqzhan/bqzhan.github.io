This paper entitled "Eye in the sky â€“ monitoring financial fraud using satellite data" was finished in the last summer and has been presented in the *International Conference on Smart Finance 2021*. 

However, due to some reasons, I could not post it on this site without the permission of the co-author. This work is interesting and innovative, yet it's not the right time to have it published now. Perhaps we will have the opportunity to introduce this work in the later future.
