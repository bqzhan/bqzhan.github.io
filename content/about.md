  | **Financial Fraud Detection**  | In this research, I was mainly responsible for conducting experiments and writing manuscript. We studied how to employ satellite data as external evidence to facilitate financial fraud detection. We designed a multi-source information incorporated machine learning framework and the framework has improved the performance of fraud detection significantly by increasing the AUC for nearly 50% comparing the results of using single source of information.          |
  | **Users' Behaviors' Changing** | In this research, I undertook data collection and empirical analysis. I collected data (e.g., users' posts, comments and reposts, etc.) from Weibo platform before and after the first outbreak of Covid-19 since 2020, and we studied the influence of social quarantine on users' behaviors on social media platforms. We used a DID model to detect whether the social quarantine has changed users' social media behavior. Our results were implicative and contributive. |

  | **The Influence of Environmental Policy** | I took every part of this research, including data collection, research design, experiments and analysis, as well as manuscript writing. This study focuses on the development of green investments in China. Specifically, we concerned the influence of environmental policy and we explored how the implement of environment policy leads the development of green investments. Using spatial econometric analysis along with text mining, we found that environmental policy plays different roles (direct effects and spillover effects) in terms of different kinds of green investments and different provinces. |
  | **Statistical Arbitrage Exploration**     | I contributed to this research in data collection, algorithm design and manuscript writing. This study examines whether statistical arbitrage opportunities could be detected in advance. We proposed a machine learning strategy in exploring statistical arbitrage opportunites. Comparing traditional co-integration models, our methods signigicantly improve the performance in both prediction accuracy and transaction profits when conducting empirical analysis with price series data obtained from Chinese security market.                                                                                  |
