<p>Well, I have kept on writing blogs since from my post-graduate. It has been nearly for 5 years. In the past days, I was used to write Chinese blogs, which are more about the notes of online courses. Yeah, I always engoy taking online courses in <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, which has taught me a lot. I feel so grateful for that. For those what I learned and what I thought, I would try to take some notes to help me better understand them. The previous blogs  are poseted in <a href="http://kibo.tech/">my old blog site</a>.</p>
<p>About two months ago, I found that I rarely recorded my research. Actually, I have spent most of time in doing research for the past few years, I believe that these research deserves more attention. That&rsquo; s the reason why I establish this site. I build this place to post my pervious research as well as the current work.</p>
<p>Ok, this is all about my blog.  I hope that more research can be posted in the near future.</p>
