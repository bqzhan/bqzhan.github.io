      <description>Well, I have kept on writing blogs since from my post-graduate. It has been nearly for 5 years. In the past days, I was used to write Chinese blogs, which are more about the notes of online courses. Yeah, I always engoy taking online courses in Coursera, which has taught me a lot. I feel so grateful for that. For those what I learned and what I thought, I would try to take some notes to help me better understand them.</description>
